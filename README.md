# LeBonPrix
University project that consists in coding the native Android App of the website [lebonprix.info](http://lebonprix.info/).

# What is it?
The website lebonprix.info was an university project from last year (it wasn't coded by me) and it compares the different prices of a searched product on the website [leboncoin.fr](https://www.leboncoin.fr/) (which is the french craiglist-like) and displays its average price.
